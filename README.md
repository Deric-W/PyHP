# PyHP-Interpreter

This repository includes a script that allows you to embed Python code like PHP code into HTML.
The script is called either by the configuration of the web server or a shebang and communicates with the web server via CGI.

Features that are ready for testing:
 - Algorithm for embedding python Code in HTML
 - Encapsulation of the variables and functions of the interpreter in a separate class (to prevent accidental overwriting)
 
 Features that are currently being worked on:
  - PHP like REQUEST array (Dictionary)
  - PHP like header function
  - Guide for installation
